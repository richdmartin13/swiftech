#### How Our Web Platform Works

DropByte uses Hugo and Github for development, Forestry for content management, Firebase for hosting, and Square & SnipCart for online payments.

`Here's the breakdown:`

###### Website Development
* Hugo is a static site generator. Much like wordpress or other sites, it uses highly customizable themes. The DropByte website is a perfect example of all that a Hugo site can do. If you'd like to learn more about Hugo, check it out [here](https://gohugo.io).  
* Github is our code management system. It allows us to be agile in how we develop your site - while some things are editible with Forestry, most of the customization is hand-coded. Plus, if your website is broken, we'll be able to quickly roll back the code and get you back up in no time.

###### Content Management
* Forestry is a content management system for Hugo sites\[^1\]. We'll set it up for you and provide you with a password that you an use with your email address. From there, you can quickly edit the content of your website, but any larger changes (ie. images, formatting, and organization) will still have to be made by us. Find out more at their [website](https://forestry.io).

###### Hosting
* Firebase is where your website is hosted. By default, your website will have a web address like \[your-name-here\].web.app, but we can set up your domain address for you, if you have one. If you don't, we'll help you get one if you like.

###### E-Commerce
* Square is a payment processing platform which allows for invoicing, online payments, e-commerce and more. To learn more about how Square works,
check out their [website](https://squareup.com).
* SnipCart is an interface for services like Square. Instead of having to use their payment flow, SnipCart allows you to seamlessly integrate payments
into your website. Find out more at [SnipCart](https://snipcart.com).

#### Website Development, Hosting, and CMS Pricing

* DropByte's website development services are charged at the standard rate of $30 per hour and are subject to the same billing practices as our Remote Support Sessions.
* Hosting and CMS services are billed for an additional $6 per month until cancelled.
* E-Commerce sites pay hosting & CMS services + vendor fees\[^2\]
* Domain registration fees and any other applicable fees will be billed to you.

\[^1\]: `Currently, we only support Hugo sites with Forestry. We can host any website that you may have code for, but we will not be able to provide content management services.`
\[^2\]: `Square's charges are 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction, and SnipCart's charges are 2% per transaction. This brings the total charge to 4.9% + 30¢ per transaction, as of the writing of this article. DropByte is not responsible for changes in prices from our vendors.`
