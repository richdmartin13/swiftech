### QuickBytes
QuickBytes are our free, snack-sized lessons on technology, made just for you. At this time, they are freely available; however, it is possible that they are placed under DropByte Premium benefits.

### Remote Support
If you have a question, need expert advice, or just have a problem that needs to be solved, our experts are just a few clicks away. Consultation Sessions[^1] are billed at $5 per session. Remote Support Sessions[^2] are billed at $30 per hour.

### DropByte Premium
DropByte Premium is a subscription offering that provides several benefits. A full list of these benefits can be found [here](https://dropbyte.ch/premium). There are four tiers:

| Tier 	| Monthly Cost 	| Service Discount 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| Basic 	| $10 per month 	| 10% 	|
| Plus 	| $20 per month 	| 20% 	|
| Pro 	| $50 per month 	| 30% 	|
| Enterprise 	| $250 per month 	| 30% 	|

[^1]: Consultation Sessions apply only if no work is done by a remote support provider. Instead, consultation sessions are for advice and discovery. These sessions are limited to 15 minutes and are billed per session. In the event that a consultation session extends past the 15 minute limit, a Remote Support Session will begin as the consultation period ends. We will always confirm this with you before proceeding.

[^2]: Remote Support Sessions involve work done by a remote support provider. Additionally, a remote support session may begin if a consultation session extends past the allotted time. These sessions are billed in hourly increments unless enrolled in a DropByte Premium Plan.
